/**
 * `chain` maps a function over a list and concatenates the results. `chain`
 * is also known as `flatMap` in some libraries.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `chain` method of the second argument, if present,
 * according to the [FantasyLand Chain spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#chain).
 *
 * If second argument is a function, `chain(f, g)(x)` is equivalent to `f(g(x), x)`.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
 *

 * @since v0.3.0
 * @category List
 * @sig Chain m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
 * @param {Function} fn The function to map with
 * @param {Array} list The list to map over
 * @return {Array} The result of flat-mapping `list` with `fn`
 * @example
 *
 *      const duplicate = n => [n, n];
 *      R.chain(duplicate, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
